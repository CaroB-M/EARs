  Other observations: '"The assembly of Prunus ramburei (drPruRamb1) is based on 42X
    PacBio data and 170X Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 36 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 3.46 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.41 Mb). Additionally, 267 regions totaling 14.15 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.97 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    and chloroplastic genomes were assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 3 haplotypic
    regions and 23 contaminant sequences were removed, totaling 5.23 Mb and 0.60 Mb,
    respectively (with the largest being 3.57 Mb and 0.062 Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size. Chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
    and 8 are assembled in a single contig, and chromosomes 1 and 2 are composed of
    two contigs. Chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 have telomeric repeats at both extremities,
    and chromosomes 5, 6, and 7 have them only at the beginning."'
