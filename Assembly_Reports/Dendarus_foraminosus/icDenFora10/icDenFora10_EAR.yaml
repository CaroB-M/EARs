  Other observations: '"The assembly of Dendarus foraminosus (icDenFora10.1) is based
    on 58X PacBio data and 82X OmniC Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 13 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 840 Kb (with the largest being 358 Kb).
    Additionally, 255 regions totaling 30.5 Mb (with the largest being 1.6 Mb) were
    identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was
    assembled using OATK ; two circular forms were assembled and named mitochondrion_1,
    mitochondrion_2. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved
    using Pretext. During manual curation, no regions were tagged as allelic duplications
    nor contaminants ; Scaffold_10 and Scaffold_11 with low coverage, and homology
    with Tenebrio molitor (X,Y) chromosomes, were renamed as X and Y respectively.
    Telomeric repeat pattern found is TCGGG. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed
    by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
