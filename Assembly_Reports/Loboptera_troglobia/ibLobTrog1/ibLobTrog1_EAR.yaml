  Contamination notes: '"Based on the blobtools report results (using -buscoregions
    species-) we removed 26 smaller scaffolds that matched mostly bacterial sequences
    (largely putative endosymbiont fragments). Some of the scaffolds also contained
    viral and fungal sequences. The scaffolds in question are: scaffold_36,scaffold_40,scaffold
    _42,scaffold_45,scaffold_48,scaffold_49,scaffold_50,scaffold_52,scaffold_53,scaffold_
    57,scaffold_59,scaffold_61,scaffold_64,scaffold_67,scaffold_68,scaffold_69,scaffold_7
    0,scaffold_71,scaffold_74,scaffold_78,scaffold_81,scaffold_83,scaffold_87,scaffold_91
    ,scaffold_93 and scaffold_109. These scaffolds were not removed form the pretext
    file but we will do so once the review process is complete. They have, however,
    already been removed from the blobtools plot and busco, merqury and gfastas included
    in the report"'
  Other observations: '"For this specimen the ONT data derived from the heteromorphic
    sex with the absense of a second sex chromosome (male X0). The number of putative
    chromosomes seems to match that of another Loboptera genus cockroach (Loboptera
    subterranea). For a number of the super scaffolds there seem to be weak contacts
    between the the two arms of the chromosomes, something we have observed in other
    Loboptera genus cockroaches as well"'
