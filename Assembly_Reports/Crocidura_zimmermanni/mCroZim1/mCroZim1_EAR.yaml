  Other observations: '"The assembly of Crocidura zimmermanni (mCroZim1.1) is based
    on 37X PacBio data and 189X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    8 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 690.5 Kb (with
    the largest being 117.9 Kb) ; TAPAs has classified two scaffolds (scaffold_102
    & scaffold_138) as bacteria, but they are host rDNA, therefore they are not removed.
    Additionally, 195 regions totaling 76.2 Mb (with the largest being 20.8 Mb) were
    identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was
    assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually
    improved using Pretext. During manual curation, no regions were tagged as allelic
    duplications nor contaminants ; 24 sequences were tagged Unloc, their orientation
    is uncertain ; the coverage of mCroZim1_5 seems lower than the others and its
    alignment with Suncus_etruscus (CM043992.1 chromosome_X) suggests that mCroZim1_5
    is the X chromosome. the difference in expected vs observed haploid number is
    noteworthy, but there is a great variability of karyotypes within this genus and
    also between individuals of the same species ; also, Crocidura zimmermanni is
    endemic (Crete) and shows a threatened status (Endangered), which could also contribute.
    Despite counting with karyotype information, that information is rather limited
    for this species ; there is no evidence of false-joins with the contact map. Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
