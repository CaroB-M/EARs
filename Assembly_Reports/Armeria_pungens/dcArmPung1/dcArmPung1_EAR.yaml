  Other observations: '"The assembly of Armeria pungens (dcArmPung1) is based on 35X
    PacBio data and Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference Genome
    Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups (sequences > 1Mb were reincorporated to the assembly), and Hi-C-based
    scaffolding with YaHS. No contamination was detected. Additionally, 1066 regions
    totaling 73 Mb (with the largest being 911 Kb) were identified as haplotypic duplications
    and removed. The mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes were assembled using OATK.
    Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext.
    During manual curation, 26 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 139 Mb (with
    the largest being 22 Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were
    named in order of size."'
