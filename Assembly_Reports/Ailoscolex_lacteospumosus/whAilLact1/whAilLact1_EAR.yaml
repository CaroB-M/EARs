Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 8
  Contamination notes: '"No true contaminants found. All scaffolds had a mix of annelid,
    mollusk and brachiopod hits. All were considered to be derived from annelid."'
  Other observations: '"Assembly with Nextdenovo and Flye did not work very well.
    Hifiasm assembly with default settings resulted in two assemblies of approximately
    one Gb each. Purging resulted in four assemblies of 450-480 Mb each. We curated
    the two purged assemblies and results were satisfacory, but a considerable amount
    of manual interventions were necessary. We tried again using the --n-hap 4 setting
    for internal purging in hifiasm resulting in a primary assembly of the appropriate
    length, few duplicate buscos and best contiguity of any assembly. We curated this
    assembly directly. We cut two contigs, removing two haplotigs. Two more were tagged
    in the shrapnel. Two unlocs were placed. Two contigs were inverted."'
