Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 73
  Contamination notes: '"No clear contaminants were found either using buscogenes
    or buscoregions (more sensitive) - did not rerun after addressing reviewers"'
  Other observations: '"The strength of the HiC signal, particularly along the diagonal
    was weaker than usual, and therefore as suggested by the reviewers, used the mq0
    pretext map for the reviewing process. With a mq0 map we were able to localize
    all unlocs, and incorporate a few more scaffolds into the main assembly. The sex
    of the specimen was set to unknown in our lims system and we were not able to
    find any sex chromosomes based on ONT coverage either"'
