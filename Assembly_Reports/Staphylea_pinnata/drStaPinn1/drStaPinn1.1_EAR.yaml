  Other observations: '"The assembly of STAPHYLEA PINNATA (drStaPinn1) is based on
    50X PacBio data and 137X Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 5 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 390 Kb (with the largest
    being 277 Kb). Additionally, 650 regions totaling 102 Kb were identified as haplotypic
    duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally,
    the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During
    manual curation, no regions were tagged as allelic duplications but 3 regions
    as contaminants (151 Kb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were
    named in order of size and contigs were already mostly chromosome-scale."'
