  Other observations: '"The assembly of Dailognatha quadricollis (icDaiQuad1) is based
    on 42X PacBio data and 177X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial phased assembly with PacBio and
    Hi-C data using hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, and Hi-C-based
    scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 0 contig were identified as contaminants (bacterial,
    archaeal, or viral). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally,
    the assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size. The larger chromosomes
    were tagged as HAP1. X chromosome was identified after doing an alignment the
    reference genome of Tenebrio molitor (icTenMoli1.1)."'
