  Other observations: '"The assembly of Ebenus cretica (drEbeCret1.4) is based on
    75X of PacBio data and Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 34 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 1.5 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.167 Mb). Additionally, 811 regions totaling 64 Mb were identified as haplotypic
    duplications and removed. Mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes was assembled
    using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using
    Pretext. During manual curation, 16 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling
    2 Mb, respectively (with the largest being 0.8 Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
