Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 367
  Contamination notes: '"We found contaminants in the yahs scaffolded assembly within
    six small scaffolds which were removed from the curated assembly submitted for
    review. The contaminants corresponded mostly to bacterial sequences (Pseudomonadota,
    Bacillota)"'
  Other observations: '"The reviewing process led to several changes in many of the
    super scaffolds, with six additional haplotigs found and removed. We found it
    very difficult to localize a number of these scaffolds (mostly centromeric) which
    were set as unlocs. The sex of the specimen was set to -unknown- in our lims system.
    We could find the sex chromosome in the assembly. We found a large haplotig (4
    Mbases) which was removed before remapping."'
