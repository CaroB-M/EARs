  Other observations: '"The assembly of LEWINSKYA ACUMINATA (cbLewAcum8) is based
    on 69X PacBio data and 202X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Nextdenovo, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    32 regions totaling 4 Mb were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed.
    Additionally, 114 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal,
    or viral), totaling 23 Mb (with the largest being 4 Mb). The mitochondrial genome
    was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually
    improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 8 haplotypic regions and 5 contaminant
    sequences were removed, totaling 423,178 pb and 456,681 pb, respectively (with
    the largest being 180,566 pb and 162,112 pb). There is a large haplotypic inversion
    between ~3.79-4.36Mb (chr 1). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data
    were named in order of size and contigs were already mostly chromosome-scale."'
