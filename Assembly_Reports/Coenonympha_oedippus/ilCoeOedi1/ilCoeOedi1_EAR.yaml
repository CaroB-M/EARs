Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 100
  Contamination notes: '"1 scaffold matching Wolbachia was removed from the Flye assembly"'
  Other observations: '"We curated the Flye assembly with exception of the W scaffold
    that was better reconstructed by Nextdenovo. We replaced the Flye W scaffold for
    the nextdenovo W scaffold. In addition, 83 small scaffolds with remaining W fragments
    or just too short were removed from the curated Flye assembly. During the review,
    we made 2 additional cuts in contigs, 6 breaks at gaps and 12 joins localizing
    5 contigs into superscaffolds"'
