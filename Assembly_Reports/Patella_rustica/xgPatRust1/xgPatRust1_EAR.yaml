Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 40
  Contamination notes: '"During the curation process we pre-labeled eight small scaffolds
    as contaminants based on their much lower ONT coverage than observed across the
    rest of the assembly. We subsequently analyzed these scaffolds using blobtools
    and confirmed that these contaminants all matched Spirochaetota. Spirocheta have
    previoulsy been found in bivalves but little is known about the characteristics
    of these associations (commensalism or parasitism). These eight scaffolds were
    not re-mapped with HiC data and are absent from the for-review pretext file. They
    were also removed from the final assembly fasta. Moreover, running blobtools (using
    species buscoregions) on the curated assembly allowed us to identify six additional
    small scaffolds (scaffold_39, scaffold_42, scaffold_43, scaffold_48, scaffold_31
    & scaffold_50) that contain fish sequence-contaminants. One of the unlocs and
    another scaffold also contained short matches to fish sequences these seemed to
    be false positive."'
  Other observations: '"The curation was generally not too difficult except that several
    of the differet centromere regions required some level of modification. We also
    found two haplotypic duplications that were removed from the pretext map sent
    for reviewing. The organism was determined to be a female but we are not sure
    of the sex determination system of this species. The curated assembly stats (gfastas,
    busco and merqury) and the blobplot were generated from the 24-sequence assembly
    after filtering out for the scaffold-containing contaminants. The pretext does
    contain the six scaffolds with fish DNA."'
