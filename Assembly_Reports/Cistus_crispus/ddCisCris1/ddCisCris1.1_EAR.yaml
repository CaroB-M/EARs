  Other observations: '"The assembly of CISTUS CRISPUS (ddCisCris1) is based on 54X
    PacBio data and 137X Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 128 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral) totaling 5.4 Mb, scaffolds classified
    as Arthropoda or Metazoa by Context were removed, as were those without taxonomic
    assignment but which aligned, even slightly, with an arthropod in blastn. Additionally,
    699 regions totaling 135 Mb were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed.
    The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, no regions
    were tagged as allelic duplications or as contaminants. Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
