Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 5
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants detected with blobtoolkit INSDC pipeline
    in the precurated assembly."'
  Other observations: '"Curation made 4 cuts in contigs, 5 breaks at gaps and 0 joins.
    The W contigs were found in the purge_dups'' hap.fa and placed back into the nextdenovo
    asseembly before yahs scaffolding. After curation and review, the W was assembled
    into 1 contig of 11.9 Mb and 37 unlocalized scaffolds totalling 99,702,411 bp.
    Consistently with the cytogenetic information we identified 10 microchromosomes
    (SUPER_7-SUPER_16). Although there are 4 scaffolds with clear contcats with them
    is not possible to place them into a unique SUPER. The link provided for the pretextmap
    points to a folder where reviewers can add additional save_states if required.
    Finally, the mitogenome has been assembled independently with FOAM into a 21,416
    bp circular contig with high accuracy."'
