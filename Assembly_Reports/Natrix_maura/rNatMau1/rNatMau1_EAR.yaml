    Haploid size (bp): 1,604,071,484
    Haploid Number: '18 (source: ancestor)'
    Ploidy: '3 (source: ancestor)'
    Sample Sex: ZW

EBP metrics:
  EBP quality code:
    collapsed: 7.8.Q46

Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 9
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants found in the precurated assembly (blob plot
    shown under the curated assembly as there is need to redo this after curation)"'
  Other observations: '"First, nextdenovo assembly with no-haplotig sequences matching
    W were rescued from hap.fa (purge_dups). Second, it was scaffolded with yahs using
    439.53 million hic pairs. Third, curation made 0 cuts in contigs, 3 breaks at
    gaps and 8 joins. Fourth, during review we made 2 additional cuts in contigs and
    8 joins (thus the W chromosome was assambled into a 16.08 Mb SUPER and 35 unlocs
    accounting for 36.68 Mb). Finally, the mitogenome was scaffolded into a single
    circular contig of 21.23 Kb. Regarding the EAR warnigs, they are unjustified:
    Chromosome number based on direct estimate in goat is 2n=34 thus the assembly
    is consistent with n=17. Smudgeplot shows this genome is clearly diploid."'
