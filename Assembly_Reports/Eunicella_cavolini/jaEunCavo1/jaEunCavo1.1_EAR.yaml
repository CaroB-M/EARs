  Other observations: '"The assembly of EUNICELLA CAVOLINI (jaEunCavo1) is based on
    53X PacBio data and 130X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 37 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 1 Mb (with the largest
    being 88,287 pb). Additionally, 208 regions totaling 168 Mb were identified as
    haplotypic duplications and removed. However, all sequences larger than 1 Mb were
    added to the assembly, with purge_dups removing too many contigs needed for the
    scaffolding. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary
    assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation,
    12 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 27 Mb (with the largest being 1.8
    Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of
    size."'
