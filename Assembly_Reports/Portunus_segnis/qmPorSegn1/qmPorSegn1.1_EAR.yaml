  Other observations: '"The assembly of PORTUNUS SEGNIS (qmPorSegn1) is based on 35X
    ONT data and 133X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Flye, removal of
    contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 30 contigs were identified
    as viral, totaling 605,419 pb (with the largest being 245,493 pb) and 108 contigs
    were identified as bacterial, totaling 2,163,401 pb (with the largest being 537,362
    pb). Additionally, 8 622 regions totaling 44 Mb were identified as haplotypic
    duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally,
    the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During
    manual curation, 79 contaminant sequences were removed, totaling 5.3 Mb (with
    the largest being 178,570 pb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data
    were named in order of size."'
