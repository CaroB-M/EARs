  Other observations: '"The assembly of CARLINA DIAE (daCarDiae1) is based on 61X
    PacBio data and 210X Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. No contigs were found to be
    contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral). But, 1,107 regions totaling 94 Mb
    were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome
    was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually
    improved using Pretext. During manual curation, no regions were tagged as allelic
    duplications or contaminants. The telemeric track is based on TAGTAG, because
    the usual pattern was not found. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C
    data were named in order of size."'
