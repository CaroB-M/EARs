Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 26
  Contamination notes: '"Scaffold_22 (1.5 MBases) was removed from the yahs scaffolded
    assembly because it was identitfied as pseudomonadota (which include symbionts
    of many arthropod species). The contaminant was removed from the yahs scaffolded
    assembly and is not present in the curated pretext which was shared."'
  Other observations: '"The HiC signal along the diagonal is quite strong. We were
    able to place several scaffolds to many of the super scaffolds but we found it
    very difficult to localize most of them. The sex of the specimen was set to -female-
    in our lims system. We could find the sex chromosome in the assembly"'
