Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 40
  Contamination notes: '"Sequences of Pseudomonadota (which include symbionts of many
    arthropod species) were present in 14 scaffolds of this organism. Scaffold_13
    and scaffold_14 and especially long regions of similarity to to sequences of bacteria
    from this phyllum. We also found eight other small scaffold with strong similarity
    to either chordata or mollusca which were also filtered out without detriment
    to the BUSCO or merqury QV. All sequences were removed from the yahs scaffolded
    assembly and are not present in the curated pretext and assembly."'
  Other observations: '"This is the second version of the EAR report for this species
    which resulted in a new assembly after addressing the changes and suggestions
    provided by the reviewers. The curation was generally straightforward and the
    HiC signal along the diagonal quite strong as we produced a lot of HiC data assuming
    the genome size to be larger than what it turned out to be. The sex of the specimen
    was set to unknown in our lims system.We were not able to detect any lower coverage
    super_scaffolds and therefore were not able to detect the sex chromsome. The curated
    assembly stats (gfastas, busco and merqury), the pretext file and the blobplot
    were generated from the assembly after filtering out for the scaffold-containing
    contaminants."'
