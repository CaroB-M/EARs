  Other observations: '"The assembly of Xanthium orientale (daXanOrie1.2) is based
    on 40X of PacBio data and Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 7 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 0.4 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.15 Mb). Additionally, 276 regions totaling 15.5 Mb (with the largest being
    0.36 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. Mitochondrial
    and chloroplast genomes was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed
    by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
