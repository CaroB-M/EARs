Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 8
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants detected in the Nextdenovo assembly selected
    for curation."'
  Other observations: '"Curation made 1 cut in a contig, 4 breaks at gaps and 9 joins.
    SUPER_Y sequence accounts for 5,195,203 bp. Despite of searching thoroughly for
    Y sequence in the purged haplotigs removed from our assemblies we did not found
    enough to scaffold the male Y chromosome. Mitogenome was not successfully assembled.
    During review we reoriented a contig in SUPER_2 and localized 3 scaffolds. Thus
    we made just 2 additional breaks at gaps and 3 additional joins."'
