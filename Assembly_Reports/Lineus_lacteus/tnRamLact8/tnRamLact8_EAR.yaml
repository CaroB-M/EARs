Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 38
  Contamination notes: '"BTK pipeline detected just false positives with short hits
    to various metazoan phylum. This is expectable as Nemertea is an undersequenced
    phylum and the hits found are short and divergent."'
  Other observations: '"The HiC data was not very good, we ended up having 7.3 million
    valid pairs for scaffolding and we dropped the mq to 10 with YaHS. However the
    scaffolding worked pretty well for such as small genome and we ended up with 19
    super-scaffolds after curation and review. During review, we ran whole genome
    alignments against tnLinLong1.2 (n=19) to confirm the join of some scaffolds into
    a single SUPER (same chromosome). Note that SUPER_8 contains a true segmental
    duplication as confirmed by coverage, ONT and self-alignments. Curation and review
    involved 4 cuts in contigs, 3 breaks at gaps and 7 joins. The pretext contact
    map and final savestate (tnRamLact8.curated_primary.no_mt.unscrubbed_mq0.extensions.pretext.savestate_3)
    are located into the multimapping folder following the shared link. Regarding
    the plastids, we did not find reads to assemble the mitogenome properly."'
