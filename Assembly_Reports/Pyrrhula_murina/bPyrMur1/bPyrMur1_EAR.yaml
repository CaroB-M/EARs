Curator notes:

  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants found."'
  Other observations: '"Haploid number within normal range. No reliable signal to
    join possible chromosome arms. Will produce an MQ0 map if necessary, but we don''t
    think it is needed. Made three breaks (yahs joined four contigs that were T2T
    into one scaffold) and two joins (had to invert one contig in SUPER_32 based on
    contact map of primary assembly, which had no gap in this chromosome). Placed
    a few unlocs. bPyrMur.hfsm.hic.hap1.yhs_scffs.curated 1,163,866,538 bp sequence
